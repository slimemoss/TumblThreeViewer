Question: <p>How many set have outright been cancelled outright other than Unglued 2? </p>
Answer: <p>Unglued 2 got the farthest, but we’ve had a handful of sets stopped before completion. I don’t think any, other than Unglued 2, have been made public.  </p>

Question: <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want every noncreature spell that flavorfully references a creature type to have the creature type on the card. It&rsquo;s a lot of extra words (in the totality of words on cards) for little mechanical gain.&rdquo; Little gain, lots of words (as a whole), and it&rsquo;s a slippery slope for what is and what isn&rsquo;t a Tribal card. Are there other downsides at play that you&rsquo;re not discussing, as those don&rsquo;t seem like big enough downsides to not do more non-creature spells with creature types?</p>
Answer: <p>While they might not seem like big enough downsides to you, they are. It’s easy to misjudge the impact of game elements when you’re very enfranchised, because your familiarity can blind you to their complications. It’s one of the first things new designers have to learn when starting at Wizards.</p>

Question: <p>In Amonkhet, the exert mechanic was only used for attack triggers. In Hour of Devastation, exert was also used on tap abilities. Can you tell us anything about why exert on tap abilities didn&rsquo;t appear until the second set with exert?</p>
Answer: <p>In blocks, we liked to have the mechanics evolve over time. </p>

Question: Have you ever wanted/had ideas to create another card game or something else entirely?
Answer: <p>Many years ago, I created a mass market TCG (trading card game) called Mood Swings that has yet to be published.  While a trading card game, it is <em>very</em> different from <strong>Magic</strong>.</p>
